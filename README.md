# credit-risk-classification

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to test the performance of a machine learning model in how reliable it was at predicting the creditworthiness of applicants. In order to evaluate this, metrics such as F1 score, recall, and precision were used. 

## Results

The overall accuracy of the model was 99%. This was made up of the healthy loans and the high risk loans. For precision level, the healthy loans were perfect, with a 1.00. High risk loans were slightly lower but still reliable, at 0.84. The recall for both was extremely good - for healthy loans it was 0.99, and for high risk loans it was 0.94. Combined, the model is extremely reliable at predicting. 

## Summary

Overall, the logistics regression model is extremely well adept to predicting the creditworthiness of loanees. It has perfect precision and almost perfect recall for healthy loans, and slightly worse, but still respectable precision and recall for high risk loans. Therefore, I recommend the model to be used.
